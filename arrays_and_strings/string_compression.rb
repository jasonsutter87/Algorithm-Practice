# there are three types of edits that can be performed on a string: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string then the method should return the original string. The original string should only have (a-z) in either upper or lowercase.

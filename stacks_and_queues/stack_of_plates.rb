#imagine a literal stack of plates. if the stack gets too high, it might topple.
#Therefore, in real life we would likely start a new stack when the privouse stack exceeds some threshold.
#Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks that should be SetOfStacks.push()
# and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same value as it would there if it
	#was still a single stack).
